description: Start a new bugfix using the OpenSpec artifact workflow (OPSX)
---

Start a new bugfix using a structured approach to identify, report, and resolve defects.

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:bugfix` is a brief description of the bug (e.g., `/opsx:bugfix login failure`).

**Steps**

1. **Information Gathering (Proactive)**

   To ensure a high-quality fix, gather details from the user one by one using the **AskUserQuestion tool**. For EACH question, attempt to provide a **"Best Guess"** based on the user's initial description to reduce their effort:

   A. **Reproduction Steps**: Present your best guess of the steps.
   Ask: > "Based on your description, here are the **reproduction steps** I've gathered. Is this correct or would you like to adjust them? [List steps]"

   B. **Expected Behavior**: Present your best guess.
   Ask: > "For the **expected behavior**, I assume it should [Guess]. Does that sound right?"

   C. **Actual Behavior**: Present your best guess.
   Ask: > "And the **actual behavior** is [Guess]? (Please correct me if I missed a detail)."

   D. **Environment**: If the bug appears to be **environment-dependent** (e.g., UI issues, browser-specific crashes, OS-level failures), ask:
   Ask: > "Are there any specific **environment details** (OS, browser, etc.) that are relevant, or should I proceed with standard defaults?"
   Otherwise, skip this question and proceed to Step 2.

   Wait for each response before moving to the next. Allow the user to "Skip" or "Confirm" if your guess is correct.

2. **Initialize the Change**

   Derive a kebab-case name prefixed with `fix-` (e.g., `fix-login-failure`).

   Run the initialization command:

   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>" --schema bugfix
   ```

3. **Draft the Proposal**

   Create the `proposal.md` in the new change directory. Use the information gathered in Step 1 to populate the bug-specific sections.

4. **Planning and Tasking**

   Run the OpenSpec status check to confirm the proposal is ready:

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

   Generate sub-artifacts and tasks:

   ```bash
   openspec ff change "<name>"
   ```

5. **Show Status and Next Steps**

   Summarize the change location and the tasks generated.

   Prompt the user:

   > "Bugfix change `<name>` initialized using the native `bugfix` schema. I've drafted the proposal and spawned the implementation tasks. Ready to start implementation? Run `/opsx:apply` or let me know if you want to refine the plan first."

**Guardrails**

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask the Information Gathering questions **one by one**. Do NOT combine them into a single message. Pause and wait for the user to respond after EACH question.
- ALWAYS gather reproduction steps before initializing the change.
- Prefix all bugfix changes with `fix-`.
- Pass `--schema bugfix` when creating the change.
- Do NOT skip the proposal phase; it's critical for documenting WHY a fix was made for future reference.
